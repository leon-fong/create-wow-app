  { "prose": "🔖 Hiding at a certain time, missing the palm prints of a period; hiding at a certain place, missing someone who stands at both the arrival and departure, the one I care about." },
  { "prose": "🔖 The sky is clear, brilliant sunlight streaming through the dense pine needles, forming beams of light that illuminate the misty shade with a delicate veil." },
  { "prose": "🔖 This encounter, beautiful to the core, tremblingly beautiful, desolately beautiful, stunningly beautiful." },
  { "prose": "🔖 The state of silence allows me to feel the freedom of breathing and my original position." },
  { "prose": "🔖 Youth is like a sunflower seed symbolizing sunshine. When sown now, it will be harvested in the future, those blossoms full of youth." },
  { "prose": "🔖 Swallows may leave and return; willows may wither and turn green again; peach blossoms may wither and bloom again. But tell me, why do our days never return once they are gone?" },
  { "prose": "🔖 Graduation marks the departure of youth imperceptibly. We are about to turn over another page of life." },
  { "prose": "🔖 Growth is every child's right and a journey they must go through, whether smooth or rugged, with joys and sorrows, partings and reunions." },
  { "prose": "🔖 People and events from the past are trivial and chaotic. My memories are fuzzy, as if most have turned into warm symbols quietly sinking in my heart." },
  { "prose": "🔖 Life is an encyclopedia encompassing all things; life is a six-stringed guitar playing multiple wonderful melodies; life is a grand clockwork horse clock that, when wound up, gives one a concentrated life experience." },
  { "prose": "🔖 Graduation sees friends going their separate ways, learning to support their own lives with warmth." },
  { "prose": "🔖 Things that have reached their end only experience another demise in rebirth. Just like all beginnings are actually pre-written conclusions." },
  { "prose": "🔖 The fragrance of afternoon tea permeates every corner of the room; the afternoon sun shines through the curtains onto the wooden table, a longing smoothly flowing into the heart along with the red tea." },
  { "prose": "🔖 This is no longer our campus; as we leave behind our youthful years." },
  { "prose": "🔖 I've been looking for you for a long time without success. When the breeze blows, I deeply breathe in, only then do I feel you accompanying me in breathing." }
